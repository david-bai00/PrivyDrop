      FAQ_dis: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      question_0:
        "Is the data truly stored locally and not transferred to other servers?",
      answer_0:
        "Yes, all data is handled locally. You can check the YouTube video on our homepageâ€”files can still be transferred within a local network even if the internet is disconnected after establishing a connection. In the future, we plan to open source the code so everyone can review it.",
      question_1: "How do I send and receive folders?",
      answer_1:
        'Sending a folder is as simple as sending a file. Drag the folder into the file selection area or click the area to select it, then hit "Start Sending." button On the receiving end, users can download directly or choose a save directory before downloading. The former saves to memory, while the latter saves directly to disk.',
      question_2: "Can I change the Room ID?",
      answer_2: "Yes, you can change the Room ID to any string you prefer.",
      question_3: "Can I share content continuously?",
      answer_3:
        'As long as you remain connected, you can manually click the "Start Sending" button to update the shared content whenever it changes.',
      question_4: "Can I share files with multiple recipients simultaneously?",
      answer_4:
        "Of course! There's no difference between one person receiving and multiple people receiving simultaneously.",
      question_5: "Is my data secure when using PrivyDrop?",
      answer_5:
        "Absolutely secure. Your data always stays local, transferring between devices through an encrypted, end-to-end connection. All transmitted data is encrypted, ensuring only you and the recipient can access it.",
      question_6: "Do I need to create an account to use PrivyDrop?",
      answer_6:
        "No registration or login requiredâ€”just open the site and start using it. Convenience and speed are our priorities.",
      question_7: "Are there any file size limits?",
      answer_7:
        "No limits on file size or speed. As long as you have enough disk space, you can transfer files of any size by setting a save directory before downloading.",
      question_8: "Can I share folders or multiple files at once?",
      answer_8:
        'Yes, sharing multiple files or folders is as simple as sharing a single file. You can also add files to the transferâ€”just click "Start Sending" to update them for the recipient.',
      question_9: "How do I stop sharing if I change my mind?",
      answer_9:
        "Stopping a share is as simple as closing the browser tab or window. Once you do this, the connection is terminated, and no further data can be transferred.",
      question_10: "Does using PrivyDrop slow down my device?",
      answer_10:
        "No, PrivyDrop is designed to be lightweight and efficient. If you set a save directory, all received data is written directly to disk, bypassing memory, which helps maintain your device's performance.",
      question_11: "Can I use PrivyDrop offline?",
      answer_11:
        "Yes, if the sender and receiver are on the same local network, they can join the same room while connected to the internet and then disconnect from it. File sharing will still work. You can refer to the YouTube video on the homepage for details.",
      question_12: "Does PrivyDrop use any servers?",
      answer_12:
        "Yes, there is indeed a lightweight server, which is used only for signaling to establish an encrypted connection. Once the connection is established, all data is transferred directly between devices through the encrypted connection.",
      question_13: "What is the expiration period for Room IDs?",
      answer_13:
        "The initial validity of a RoomId is 24 hours. If a recipient joins the room, the validity is automatically extended by 24 hours from that moment.",
